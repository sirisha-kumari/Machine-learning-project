# Machine-learning-project

Description:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of recognizing handwritten digits from images using a neural network built with TensorFlow. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which is a widely-used dataset consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The project encompasses several stages, including data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and image prediction.

Detailed Description:

1.Data Loading and Preprocessing:
The MNIST dataset is loaded using TensorFlow's built-in functions.
The images are normalized by dividing pixel values by 255.0 to scale them between 0 and 1. This step is crucial for improving the performance and convergence speed of the neural network.
The first image of the training dataset is displayed using Matplotlib to visualize the data.

2.Model Building:
A sequential neural network model is constructed using TensorFlow's Keras API.
The model architecture includes:
A Flatten layer to convert the 28x28 pixel images into a 1D array of 784 elements.
A dense hidden layer with 128 neurons and ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function to introduce non-linearity.
An output layer with 10 neurons and softmax activation function to produce probability distributions for each digit class (0-9).

3.Model Compilation:
The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer, which is known for its efficiency and performance in training neural networks.
The loss function used is sparse_categorical_crossentropy, suitable for multi-class classification tasks.
The model's performance is measured using the accuracy metric.

4.Model Training:
The model is trained on the normalized training dataset for 10 epochs. The number of epochs can be adjusted to improve performance.
During training, the model learns to minimize the loss function by adjusting the weights through backpropagation.

5.Model Evaluation:
After training, the model is evaluated on the test dataset to determine its accuracy and generalization performance.
The achieved accuracy is printed as a percentage.

6.Image Preprocessing for Prediction:
A function is defined to preprocess external images of handwritten digits.
The function converts the image to grayscale, inverts the colors to match the MNIST data format, resizes the image to 28x28 pixels, normalizes the pixel values, and reshapes it to the required input shape for the model.

7.Digit Prediction:
An external image of a handwritten digit is preprocessed using the defined function.
The model predicts the digit by producing probability distributions for each class, and the class with the highest probability is chosen as the predicted digit.
The predicted digit and the preprocessed image are displayed using Matplotlib.

This project provides a comprehensive introduction to neural network-based image classification using TensorFlow, covering essential machine learning concepts and techniques. It can be extended further by experimenting with different model architectures, data augmentation techniques, and hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy and robustness.
